  The project has a provision for the complainer to add a file of his complaint . Also , he can modify and display the existing file.
  Adding file involves getting different inputs from user and storing it in a text file. Stored files can be searched based on id or type of     complaint and then displayed.
  It tells us the information of the police officer assigned to the case. Police officer is added to the case after the complaint while is       generated.
  Police officer is assigned based on the categories depending on the id number of case from the queue.
  Existing files can be viewed by the complainer or the police officer at any point of time whenever required.
  The solved cases are later deleted manually after the case is solved or even the user can delete the case he filed.
